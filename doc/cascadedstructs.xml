<Heading>Cascaded Structures as Coordinate Sytems</Heading>

Cascaded structures are composite structures that can be built from permutation
groups and/or
transformation semigroups. They are groups and semigroups themselves but they
act on coordinate tuples not on points and they retain the component actions.


<Section Label="sec:cascade shell">
The components are given a list where the order does matter. The first one is
the top level, least-dependent component.
The cascade shell  should be thought only as a framework in which
we can coordinatize states and transformations.

In sum, cascaded structures are containers for permutation groups and transformation semigroups that act on coordinate tuples (cascaded states) connected by a set of dependency functions (cascaded operations).

    <Section Label="sec:cascaded state"> <Heading>Cascaded States</Heading>
      Cascaded states are the elements of the direct product of the components in the hierarchical order. In other words, cascaded states are tuples having values for each coordinate level from the corresponding components.

    <Section Label="sec:cascaded operation"> <Heading>Cascaded Operations</Heading>
Cascaded operations are lot more complicated objects than cascaded states. They are NOT elements of the direct product of the components' operations, but they contain dependecy functions by which the required component actions can be obtained.
