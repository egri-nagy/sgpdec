<Heading>Cascaded Structures as Coordinate Sytems</Heading>

Cascaded structures are composite structures that can be built from permutation
groups and/or
transformation semigroups. They are groups and semigroups themselves but they
act on coordinate tuples not on points and they retain the component actions.

The components are given a list where the order does matter. The first one is
the top level, least-dependent component.
The cascade shell  should be thought only as a framework in which
we can coordinatize states and transformations.
