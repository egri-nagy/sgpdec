##  <Func Name="OrignalStructureOf" Arg="decomp"/>
##  <Oper Name="CascadedStructureOf" Arg="object"/>
##  <Description>
##  Access to the original structure and for the resulting cascaded structure.
##  The cascaded structure can be requested from any object which is in relation with a cascaded structure 
##  (cascaded states, cascaded operations, decompositions).

# <#GAPDoc Label="Raise">
# <ManSection>
# <Oper Name="Raise" Arg="decomp,element" Comm="lifts the element into the decomposition"/>
# <Description>
# The operation lifts an <Arg>element</Arg> (member of the original structure) into the decomposition structure. It works for both states and operations.
# As the answer is not unique in the general case different calls may return different coordinatizations of the flat element.

# <#GAPDoc Label="Flatten">
#<ManSection>
#   <Oper Name="Flatten" Arg="decomp,cascadedelement" Comm="maps a cascaded element back into the origianl structure"/>
#   <Description>
#    The operation maps a cascaded element (both states and operations) back into the original structure (flat, uncoordinatized).

# <#GAPDoc Label="Interpret">
# <ManSection>
# <Oper Name="Interpret" Arg="decomp,level,state" Comm="the meaning of a state of a component in the context of the original"/>
# <Description>
# This method shows the 'meaning' of a state of a component of the decomposition in the context of the original structure. Basically, this answers questions like, 'We have 3 states on the second level, but what do they correspond to?'.

# <#GAPDoc Label="ComponentActions">
# <ManSection>
# <Oper Name="ComponentActions" Arg="decomp,operation,state" Comm=""/>
# <Description>
# The actions in the components when for a flat element (permutation or transformation)
#  acts on a cascaded state. Usually lifting an operation into a cascaded operation
#  involves calculating these component actions.
