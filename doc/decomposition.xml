<Func Name="OrignalStructureOf" Arg="decomp"/>
<Oper Name="CascadeShellOf" Arg="decomp"/>
<Description>
Access to the original permutation group or transformation semigroup which
was decomposed.
Also the cascade shell that were used to decomposition can be accessed.

<Oper Name="Interpret" Arg="decomp,level,state" Comm="the meaning of a state of a component in the context of the original"/>
<Description>
This method shows the 'meaning' of a state of a component of the decomposition in the context of the original structure. Basically, this answers questions like, 'We have 3 states on the second level, but what do they correspond to?'.

<#GAPDoc Label="ComponentActions">
<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ComponentActions" Arg="decomp,operation,state" Comm=""/>
<Description>
The actions in the components when for an original permutation or transformation
acts on a cascaded state. Usually lifting an operation into a cascaded operation
 involves calculating these component actions.
