<Section Label="finiteset"><Heading>Finite Sets</Heading>
The holonomy decomposition works by a detailed analysis how semigroup <M>S</M> acts on a set <M>X</M> and some of its subsets.
These subsets can be numerous, therefore we would like to store them efficiently. We store these finite sets
as lists of bits using <Ref Attr="BlistList" BookName="ref"/>.
For readability we include a few functions to create an illusion that we have a dedicated data structure, thus we
can create, display and act on finite sets.

<Section Label="skeleton"><Heading>Skeleton</Heading>
The skeleton of a transformation semigroup is a data structure containing information about the action on the state set. For instance, the set of images, their strongly connected components and mapping between and within these components. These details are calculated by the <Package>Semigrops</Package> package.

The <Ref Func="Skeleton" BookName="sgpdec"/> already contains lots of information on the components of the decomposition but we still need to put them together in a form of a cascade semigroup.
