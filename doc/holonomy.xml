<Section Label="finiteset"><Heading>Finite Sets</Heading>
The holonomy decomposition works by a detailed analysis how semigroup <M>S</M> acts on a set <M>X</M> and some of its subsets.
These subsets can be numerous, therefore we would like to store them efficiently. We store these finite sets
as lists of bits using <Ref Attr="BlistList" BookName="ref"/>.
For readability we include a few functions to create an illusion that we have a dedicated data structure, thus we
can create, display and act on finite sets.

The <Ref Func="Skeleton" BookName="sgpdec"/> already contains lots of information on the components of the decomposition but we still need to put them together in a form of a cascade semigroup.
