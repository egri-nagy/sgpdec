The values of the following configuration variables can change the behavior of
the package. They are fields of the record <C>SgpDecOptionsRec</C>
Their value can be modified any time. The default values are stored
in the file named <F>config</F>.

<ManSection>
<Var Name="PARANOID"/>
<Description>
Thorough checks are performed if this is set true.
Used for establishing correctness but can have significant performance
penalties.
Default value is <C>false</C>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Var Name="STRAIGHTWORD_REDUCTION"/>
<Description>
Some algorithms can do on the fly reduction of words to straight words if this
variable is set true. This gives smaller footprint for decompositions but needs
more processing time. Default value is <C>true</C>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Var Name="SMALLER_GENERATOR_SET"/>
<Description>
<C>SgpDec</C> can try to reduce the number of generators of a permutation
group by calling <C>SmallGeneratingSet</C> if this
variable is set true.
Default value is <C>false</C>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Var Name="LINEAR_NOTATION"/>
<Description>
 Transformations are displayed in linear notation
(see <Ref Subsect="LinearNotation" Style="Number"/>)
if this is set to true. Default is <C>false</C>,
as it can be confusing for someone not familiar with linear notation.
Also, setting this parameter has its effect only when loading the
<C>SgpDec</C> package. Default value is <C>false</C>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Var Name="SMALL_GROUPS"/>
<Description>
Information on small groups can be retrieved on the fly during calculations
using <Code>StructureDescription</Code>,
however this could die on bigger groups and there is an overhead in all cases.
Default is <C>true</C>.
