<TitleComment>
Hierarchical composition and decomposition of finite permutation groups and
transformation semigroups.
</TitleComment>

<Abstract>
This  &GAP; <Package>4.10</Package> package contains implementations
of hierarchical decompositions of transformation
semigroups (Krohn-Rhodes theory) and permutation groups. Cascade products
(substructures of the wreath product) can be constructed by explicitly giving
the dependency functions between the components or can be obtained by the
decomposition algorithms (holonomy for semigroups and Lagrange-Frobenius
decomposition for groups).

This documentation does not contain rigorous definitions of the used mathematical concepts, however the references point to easily accessible preprints that describe the constructions in detail. Those papers also provide an extensive list of related monographs and research papers.
