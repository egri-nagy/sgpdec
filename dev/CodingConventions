IMPLEMENTATION FILES *.gi

The file starts with the new functions, then the reimplemented methods, clearly separated by a banner.

LOOP VARIABLES

For looping through integers {i,j,k,l} should be used. For looping some other typed elements a telltale name should be used. e.g. 'for repr in cosetreprs'.

VERBOSITY

Informal printouts should be restricted to one line only. (easy to comment out)

DEFAULT VARIABLES

decomp - HierarchicalDecomposition
cstr - CascadedStructure
cs - CascadedState
co - CascadedOperation

!. ACCESS

Accessing record elements via !. should appear only in access functions.
