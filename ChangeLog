0.7.10
	Clean up in FL decomposition and further simplification in the holonomy decomposition code. Tile-terminology is back.
0.7.9
	Holonomy decomposition is back but only in pieces.
0.7.8
	Lagrange decomposition and  Skeleton is back. Thin layer for boolean lists to behave as finite set added.
0.7.7
	CascadeGroup added and code shared with CascadeSemigroup now lifted to CascadeProduct. New codebase is ready to reintegrate Lagrange Decomposition.
0.7.6
	AsTransformation method for string (containing linear notation) and int (size of domain) added.
0.7.5
	Mixed components are allowed again, with minimal code changes. Further cleanups following the DependencyFunction separation. New test case for checking lifting as well.
0.7.4.
	Dependency functions are now separated for each level, thus cascades become tuples of dependency functions. Exactly as described mathematically.
0.7.3
	Numerous renamings, unified DomainOf and DependencyDomainsOf for cascades and cascade semigroups. IdentityCascade added. Test scripts updated.
0.7.2
	DotCascade reimplemented with better drawing style. The whole domain tree is drawn and nontrivial dependenices are highlighted.
0.7.1
	Unified ComponentDomains instead of the confusing and long ComponentDomainsOfCascade and ComponentDomainsOfCascadeSemigroup.
0.7
	Restarting the development with a new and clean implementation of cascade products. Better integration with existing semigroup functions, for instance added IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup. SemigroupWreathProduct working.
