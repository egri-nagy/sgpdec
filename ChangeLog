0.7.4.
	Dependency functions are now separated for each level, thus cascades become tuples of dependency functions. Exactly as described mathematically.
0.7.3
	Numerous renamings, unified DomainOf and DependencyDomainsOf for cascades and cascade semigroups. IdentityCascade added. Test scripts updated.
0.7.2
	DotCascade reimplemented with better drawing style. The whole domain tree is drawn and nontrivial dependenices are highlighted.
0.7.1
	Unified ComponentDomains instead of the confusing and long ComponentDomainsOfCascade and ComponentDomainsOfCascadeSemigroup.
0.7
	Restarting the development with a new and clean implementation of cascade products. Better integration with existing semigroup functions, for instance added IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup. SemigroupWreathProduct working.
